This was my UCSB Master's thesis project titled, "A Level-Set Approach to Simulating Dendritic Crystal Growth on Irregular Domains". Please find 5 folders titled:

- Codes
- images
- Snowflake Videos
- tex
- Thesis_Latex

The Codes directory contains all the Matlab codes used to run my program. To run the simulation, run the Snowflake_Time_Dendrites.m script file. This will open a time lapse type figure of the dendritic crystal growth.

The images directory contains all the figures used in the PDF report.

The Snowflake Videos directory contains three examples of crystal growth with varying parameters.

The tex directory contains the .tex files that are included in my Thesis report such as the title page and abstract.

The Thesis_Latex directory contains all the Latex files generatred when the Latex file is converted into a PDF.

For an in depth explanation of the math and programming, please read the Thesis_Report.pdf file
