First and foremost, I offer my sincerest gratitude to my graduate research advisor, Dr. Frederic Gibou, Professor of Mechanical Engineering UCSB, for his unwavering encouragement and guidance. I thank Raphael Egan for his patience and for taking me under his computational wing. I thank my parents for their wise counsel and sympathetic ear. And I thank my friends who kept me sane throughout the crazy ride that is graduate school.
